<h3>Deployment Automation &amp; DevOps</h3>
<p>Deployment Automation is managing the differences between environments in a reliable way. </p>
<p>Differences can be anything. From the number of virtual CPU's, OS patch level, or the application settings that hide in all kinds of places like property files or databases.
</p><p>Tools are a great start to notice differences and to take action to correct differences. CFEngine, puppet, XebiaLabs are all tools that can be fit for purpose.
Several times I have even created custom deployment automation tooling.</p>
<p>Whether custom or bespoke, I can assist your organization in automating and modeling your deployments. Application-release specific information and environment-release specific information, a repository for installable artefacts and a framework to glue them all together is always the foundation for deployment automation.</p>
