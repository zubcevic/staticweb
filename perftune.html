<h3>Performance Monitoring &amp; Tuning</h3>
<p>
Enterprise applications need to be reliable and predictable. How do you manage that?
Well it starts with a solid enterprise application which is translated to a software solution build up by many new or existing components which are deployed unto several infrastructural components.
</p>
<p>
Do you understand the dynamic behavior of your application and infrastructure?
</p>
<p>
As a performance tuning expert I can assist your organization in understanding the runtime behavior of your application in the wild.
Root cause analysis will help determine the main performance bottlenecks and a scalability model will further increase the understanding of the application and infrastructure in the right scale of use.
