<h3>Application Development Services</h3>
<p>
In the past I have worked on several large enterprise applications in the Financial Services sector. I started as a Java developer in 2000 with the initial implementations of Enterprise Application Servers. Since 2003 I became the lead developer and later on the software architect for several projects at large banks.
The last 6 years, I have focussed more and more on the runtime environments and bridged the gaps between development and operations. 
</p>
<p>Today, as a solution architect, my software development knowledge and experience lets me make the right decisions and coach both Dev and Ops teams in implementing the desired solutions.</p>
